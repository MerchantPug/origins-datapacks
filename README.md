# Pug's Datapacks for Origins.
Here's a single repo for the datapacks that I've made for the Origins mod after a certain point in time. Any dependencies will be mentioned within the respective READMEs.

### Datapacks
#### Extra Origins Variants
`inchling-variant` - Modifies the Inchling origin to fit my own personal design principles.

#### Slightly Modified
`phantom-slightly-modified` - Slightly modifies the Phantom Origin to be less about eating whilst phantomised, as well as implementing some QoL changes.
