# Inchling Modified
## This datapack is unfinished at the moment, please check back later.

For those who want a inchling modification that cuts out things that don't feel like they belong on the origin, and also changes stuff to fit within my own design preferences.

For the Bitesized version, which keeps the Inchling at its original size, please check when the Origin is released.

### Changelog
- Inchling is now half of the average player's size instead of previously being a quarter of the average player's size.
- Dropped items are now the same size as a regular player's drops.
- Jockey is now activated by right clicking on a player with an empty mainhand.
