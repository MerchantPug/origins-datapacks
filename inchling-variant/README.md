# Inchling Variant

An Inchling modification that changes stuff to fit within my own design preferences.
This is pretty much a "What if I designed Inchling" datapack.

I would personally recommend playing this with a keybind crawl mod, so you can still go through slabs and stairs.

For the Bitesized version, which keeps the Inchling at its original size, please go [here.](https://github.com/MerchantPug/origins-datapacks/tree/main/inchling-variant-bite-sized)

### Changelog
- Updated descriptions to be much less wordy.

- Inchling's extra hitbox width no longer affects block collisions, it has also been reduced to 150% of the Inchling's size instead of 200% to compensate for the now larger Inchling.
- Now has 3 less hearts of health instead of 5.
