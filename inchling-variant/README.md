# Inchling Variant
## This datapack is unfinished at the moment, please check back later.

For those who want a inchling modification that cuts out things that don't feel like they belong on the origin, and also changes stuff to fit within my own design preferences.
This is pretty much a "What if I designed Inchling" datapack.

For the Bitesized version, which keeps the Inchling at its original size, please check when the Origin is released.
