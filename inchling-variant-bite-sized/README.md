# Inchling Variant (Bite Sized)

This is a version of Inchling Variant for those who wish to keep Inchling at the same size as it is in Extra Origins.

### Changelog
This changelog is in comparison to [Inchling Variant](https://github.com/MerchantPug/origins-datapacks/tree/main/inchling-variant), please read up on what the changes are over there before you decide to get this version.
- Instead of being half the size of a player, an Inchling will have the same scales as it does in the base Extra Origins.
- The exception to the above is that this still uses Interaction Hitbox Width, rather than Hitbox Width for making Inchlings more fair in combat, the size increase there is the same as Extra Origins Inchling's Hitbox Width increase (x2).
- Decreased amount of max health back to 5 hearts by default, rather than 6 hearts.
