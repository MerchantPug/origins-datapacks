# Elytrian Slightly Modified
For those who want minor tweaks to Elytrian to make its gameplay a little more fluid (in my opinion).

If you want more changes, I'd recommend [Epileson](https://modrinth.com/project/epileson) to give Elytrian a new armor option for post Ender Dragon.

### Changelog
- Gift of the Winds' cooldown reduced to 20 seconds (previously 30).
- Gift of the Winds can be activated while fall flying to launch yourself in the direction you're looking. It is on the same cooldown as the normal Gift of the Winds.
- Aerial Combatant's damage modifier has been decreased to 1.5x instead of 2x.

### Dependencies
*None.*
